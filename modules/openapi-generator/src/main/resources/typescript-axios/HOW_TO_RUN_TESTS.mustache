# How to run generated tests

Welcome to the tests generated by the API Testing VS Code Extension. Here are the steps to get up & running:

1. In the *api-testing* folder, open a terminal window and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
2. Create a `.env` file to add any required environment variables, that might be referred in your `api-tests-config.ts` file as well
3. [*Optionally*] Install **Playwright Test for VSCode** VS Code Extension using [this guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) to get test runner capabilities right into VS Code.
4. Run (& debug) tests, either using the VS Code test runner or by running the `npx playwright test` command in the `api-testing` directory.

## How to provide your own data for data generation

1. Create a folder called `data` in the root directory.
2. In the data folder, create a file with name [Operation]_[Verb].json. (The name can be found in the generated data files as well). The structure of the json file should look like this:
```json
{
    "param1": "value1", // could be a path/body/header parameter as defined in Swagger
    "body": { } // requestBody if applicable
}
```
3. If any file exists for a given operation with a valid name, the test data generated will be based off of this file.
